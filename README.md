Python code that reads a list of recipients from a CSV file and sends a customized email to each recipient using the same email template 


The Steps:

1- Import necessary modules: The first step in the code is to import the necessary modules, which are csv and smtplib. The csv module is used to read the list of recipients from a CSV file, and the smtplib module is used to send the email.

2- Define the email template: The next step is to define the email template as a string variable. The template includes placeholders for the recipient's name and other information.

3- Define a function to customize the email for each recipient: The code defines a function called customize_email that takes in the recipient's name and email address and returns a customized email string. The function uses the email template from step 2 and replaces the {name} placeholder with the recipient's name.

4- Read the list of recipients from a CSV file: The code uses the with statement to open a CSV file called "recipients.csv" and creates a csv.reader object to read the rows of the file. The code then extracts the email address from each row and adds it to a recipient_list variable.

5- Use a loop to send the customized email to each recipient: The code uses a for loop to iterate over each email address in the recipient_list variable. For each recipient, the code calls the customize_email function to create a customized email string, replaces the placeholders with the recipient's information, and sends the email using the smtplib module.

Note that you'll need to replace the recipient_list variable assignment with the path to your own CSV file containing the list of recipients, replace the code to retrieve the recipient's name with your own implementation, and replace the code to send the email with the API or library for your email client.
