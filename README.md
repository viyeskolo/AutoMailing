Python code that reads a list of recipients from a CSV file and sends a customized email to each recipient using the same email template 

we use the csv module to read the list of recipients from a CSV file called "recipients.csv". The with statement opens the file and creates a csv.reader object, which we can use to iterate over the rows of the file. In this case, we assume that each row contains a single email address in the first column.

You'll need to replace the recipient_list variable assignment with the path to your own CSV file containing the list of recipients. Additionally, you'll need to replace the code to retrieve the recipient's name with your own implementation. Finally, you'll need to replace the code to send the email with the API or library for your email client.
